Guest Mode
When an user isn't logged in and creates or answer a poll, a new User is created in the database flagged as guest.
Then a authentication Token is generated and sended to the frontend.
This token is identical to the Token of a non-guest user, and will be kept in the Local Storage.
In the frontend, the guest user has access to the register/login page.
When he does one or the other, all of the polls and answers from the guest user are transfered to the non-guest user.
