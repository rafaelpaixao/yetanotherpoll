Here's the take home test. We'd like this code to be run locally. Let me know if you have questions.

Desired features, in order of priority:
1 - A user can come to the webpage and create a new poll.
2 - The user should be able to specify a title for the poll, a brief description, and a list of options.
3 - After the poll is created, the user should be able to edit the poll, and modify anything they specified originally.
4 - After the poll is created, the user should be able to share their poll with their friends. This can be as simple as generating a link that they can have other people go to to respond to the poll.
5 - The user should be able to view a graph of the responses to their poll.
6 - A user responding to a poll should be able to edit their response. (You do not need to authenticate users attempting to edit responses)
7 - A user should be able to create an account that they can authenticate to with a username and password.
8 - The only information you need is a username and password. If email addresses are usernames, you do not need to validate the email address.
9 - Passwords must be securely stored.
10 - Rate-limiting of authentication requests and account lockout do not need to be implemented.
11 - A user should be able to associate all of their previously created polls with that account.
12 - The user, when authenticated, should be able to view all of the polls associated with their account.
13 - The user should be able to require all respondents to their polls authenticate before being able to respond to the poll.
