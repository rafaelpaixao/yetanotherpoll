- User can create, edit, vote and change his vote on polls without being authenticated. After registration, all polls and answers should be associated with that user.

Guest Mode
When an user isn't logged in and creates or answer a poll, a new User is created in the database flagged as guest.
Then a authentication Token is generated and sended to the frontend.
This token is identical to the Token of a non-guest user, and will be kept in the Local Storage.
In the frontend, the guest user has access to the register/login page.
When he does one or the other, all of the polls and answers from the guest user are transfered to the non-guest user.
